# birthday_wisher
Abstract-This project is built on the framework of python and it can 
also be seen as primitive or basic model of AI technology.

Introduction-This project automatically sends birthday wishes via mail for 
all the data provided to the algorithm. It takes the data in the 
specific format(.csv). 
The modules like pandas, Smptlib are used in the framework.
Pandas is used to covert the information into data frame and 
Smptlib is used to send mail.
Multiple letter templates can be loaded into parent directory
that will be selected randomly as the body of the mail.

Conclusion-This project may be seen as a small-scale implementation of 
programs used by mega companies like Google, Facebook, 
Linkedin that collects user data and sends birthday wishes 
using AI chatbots. The higher versions of this program can be 
used as task reminders
